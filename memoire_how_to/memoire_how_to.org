#+TITLE: Writing my Master's Thesis
# Local Variables:
# eval: (orwell-mode) 
# End:

I wrote this post while preparing my Master's thesis for the /Economie et
sciences humaines/ (M2) program at Paris 1 University - Pantheon Sorbonne.
Writing a thesis is not the product of genius or sheer inspiration but of
careful organization and discipline. Since I had no previous experience in
research methods, the summer vacation preceding the start of the M2, I read
a couple books to hone my writing and archival management skills. In this
post, I compiled some suggestions useful for preparing a thesis and
commented how these were applied to mine. 

My first suggestion is to find a good book (or acquaintance) with advice on
thesis writing that fits your department's requirements. Read (or consult)
them before starting to research, as they can prevent squandering months
chasing after false starts and /hors-sujets/. In my case, although I skimmed
through Umberto Eco's venerable /Come is fa una tesi di laurea/, I
concentrated on Michel Beaud's /L'art de la these/ because his suggestions
better fit the demands and the schedule of a French Master's thesis. Thus,
most of the suggestions I discuss herein regarding research planning,
archival management, and writing organization are more-or-less his.

* 無 Tools
Mastering time saving tools and skills requires long hours of study and
practice. As counterintuitive as it seems, to save time, you must first
"waste" it. With this in mind, Beaud recommends spending time learning and
implementing a note taking method that allows easy tagging and retrieval of
research notes. Since in the 21^st century most students will pick a
computer for this task, think carefully about your choice of
software---whatever this be, make sure to learn it thoroughly.

I must confess that I am not satisfied with the setup I devised, mainly,
because it is unpractical for other people.

[[./sync0_desktop.jpg]]

I did most thesis work with a laptop, French school notebooks (/grands
carreaux/), cardboard archivers, and binders:

[[./grands_carreaux.jpg]]

My laptop is a Lenovo X230 i7 with 16GB RAM, one SATA 250GB SSD running
Arch Linux, and one M.2. 250GB SSD running Windows 10.
** Software
I stopped using Microsoft Word after strugglign to use its equation editor
for my undergrad statistics classes. Since then, I take class notes,
research notes, etc. in LaTeX. If you have never used it, LaTeX is a markup
language for typesetting. 

 After changing to I used Emacs' Org mode to
plan, draft, and write the thesis. If the source code interests you, visit
the ~org~ files.

Using the org exporter, I exported the ~org~ files into ~LaTeX~, and then into pdfs.

If you don't have a system as powerful as Emacs' Org mode, then this system
might be to cumbersome for you. But if you have enough technical skills,
the advice herein might boost your productivity. 

So the audience for this post is very reduced. That said, even if you
aren't interested in mastering any of the software tools I discuss, the
advice on the organization of the thesis by stages might be of some use.

** Bibliography Management
I used Mendeley to maintain a bibliography file called ~master.bib~. 
** Typography
I used LaTeX's KOMA Script class ~scrbook~.
** Fonts
I only used non-proprietary fonts: The main font is Linux Libertine,
alongside Linux Biolinum and Liberation Mono.
** File Organization
 I included detailed comments on the organization of the thesis' files in
 the dedicated GitHub [[https://github.com/sync0/memoire_m2][repository]]. Since it is publicly available, you can
 download them and take a look.
* 完 Writing
I decided to write my thesis in English because, after measuring the
waters, I concluded that the dismal chances of becoming a European citizen
thwarted any serious plans of a stable academic career in France. Simply
put, I refuse to be the eternal adjunct. As Oscar Wilde declared [change
this word]: "Man should not be ready to show that he can live like a badly
fed animal."

Writing in a foreign language---as I am not a native speaker of
English---adds to the problem of clear writing the problem of style.

The problem of clear writing also affects native speakers: Unlike speaking,
writing does /not/ just flow. There is a technical aspect to writing that has
to be mastered. No one could ever learn to brew good coffee by just staring
at the master barista produce a well-balanced cup; hands-on experience is
irreplaceable. Good writing requires mastering English expression, which is
only possible by writing constantly---ideally daily---and allocating a
specific time of the day for writing. Make this a habit, and defend it from
all interruptions. If you are not convinced of the solemnity of your art,
forget about having others take it seriously---/Since you are not busy,
could you give me a hand with X?/ Sorry, but I /am/ busy.

The problem of style, likewise, is not exclusive to foreign speakers of
English; as discussed in the previous paragraph, good writing is not the
product of genius but of practice. Receiving an education in English, as I
did in university, does not guarantee the development of a graceful style.
So, yes, even native speakers produce prose of less-than-average literary
merit. But for the foreign writer of English, the problem of style takes a
different tone: "We do not use this word in that way", "This phrasing is
awkward", "I understand what you mean, but I wouldn't say it that way",
etc. There is no quick fix, and steps must be taken over the years to
improve written expression. The first step is to emulate the style of a
good writer: I often return for inspiration to the forceful prose of Oscar
Wilde or George Orwell. For more concrete suggestions, I also found Strunk
and White's /The Elements of Style/ and William Zinsser's /On Writing Well/
helpful to polish my own style. Unfortunately, written expression only
merits a dim of attention in grad programs and, thus, is rarely taken
seriously by the overburdened and precarious grad student. Unless I am so
forced by penury, I refuse to churn out academic writing to wedge doors and
swell CVs.

* 無 Selected Readers
One of the best suggestions found in Beaud's book is finding a group of
selected readers to comment on the thesis materials at different stages. 
* 無 Stages to Finish a Master's Thesis
I have clustered the steps to complete the Master's thesis in six stages. I
will present them before going into detail:

A. Preparatory Research Stage
   1. Choice of Subject-matter.
   2. First Sifting.
   3. Draft of the Framework.
B. Research Stage
   1. Framework.
   2. Research Plan.
   3. Research.
C. Preparatory Writing Stage
   1. Draft of the Outline.
   2. Draft of  Writing Plan. 
   3. Additional Research.
D. Writing Stage
   1. Draft of the First Draft of the Thesis.
   2. Outline and Writing Plan.
   3. First Draft of the Thesis.
   4. Last Draft of the Thesis.
   5. Final Version of the Thesis .
E. Jury Stage
   1. Agreement of Thesis Adviser for Jury
   2. Fine Tuning of the Final Version of the Thesis.
   3. Printing. 
   4. Due Diligence for Jury.
   5. Jury.
** Preparatory Research Stage
*** Choice of Subject-matter
 Reflect on these two questions: What are you trying to answer? What's the
 purpose of writing about this subject-matter?

 - [ ] Choose the subject-matter.
*** First Sifting
 Identify how many texts (one, two, a thousand?) there are to read on the subject.

 To quickly identify the key texts, peruse and cross check the
 bibliographies of those texts that catch your attention. If a text is cited
 several times therein, it is an important text. After identifying a long
 list of texts, prioritize their reading. For this thesis, I have adopted
 the following hierarchy: [fn:2]

 - ~#A~: Key text: A must read.
 - ~#B~: Important text: Read this because of the importance of the author or what he/she represents.
 - ~#C~: Ancillary text: Choose whether to read this based on the progress of the thesis.
 - ~none~: Boundary text: Choose whether to read this if there remains any time.

 When approaching a text, don't read everything, and don't read as a
 machine. 

   - [ ] Identify the key texts---those to be read and analyzed as
     soon as possible because of their direct relation to the subject-matter.
   - [ ] Identify the key authors---those to be read, heard, or consulted with.
*** Draft of the Framework
 For convenience's sake, I call /Framework/ the group consisting of the main
 question, the nodal points, the secondary questions, the research
 hypotheses, the scope and interrelations, the methodology, and the sources.
 The Framework is a compass to research; it will prevent sailing
 astray into ancillary topics.

 For now, we define a Draft of the Framework consisting of the main question,
 the research hypotheses, and the methodology. 

 The heart of the Framework is the Main Question---the guiding light to
 research and (later) writing. This is the /most/ important aspect of the
 thesis work. Working out a sloppy question is akin to pursuing a mirage in
 the desert. The only way to discriminate good questions from sloppy
 questions is by reading about methodology in your own field and perhaps
 some philosophy of science.

 Remember to restrain that impulse to delve into every debate around the
 Main Question in the thesis. This is both wasteful and impossible.

 We check with the thesis adviser to incorporate his comments and criticism
 into the Framework.

 (I couldn't find a good translation for /axes d'interpretation/, but I had to
 include it as an essential part of the methodology: This term refers to the
 theoretical perspective---the lens, the angle of attack---used to appraise
 the Main Question. Spend some time thinking about this matter. Despite the
 American belief on the possibility of simply /stating the facts/, serious
 academic work should be aware of its own methodology, its limits, its
 context. Should I be right, a sizable portion of what passes for academic
 writing would be denounced for its laziness and redundancy. Finding out the
 degree to which this evil afflicts your academic department is left to you,
 oh reader, as an exercise.)

 - [ ] Write the Draft of the Framework:
   - [ ] Main Question.
   - [ ]Scope and interrelations.
     - [ ] Nodal points. 
   - [ ] Research hypotheses.
   - [ ] Methodology.
     - [ ] Debates & controversies around the main question.
     - [ ] Axes d'interpretation.
 - [ ] Before proceeding, check the Draft of the Framework with the thesis
   adviser.
** Research Stage
*** Framework 
 Incorporating the thesis adviser's comments, define a complete Framework:
 - [ ] Write the Framework:
   - [ ] Main Question.
     - [ ] Secondary questions.
   - [ ]Scope and interrelations.
     - [ ] Nodal points. 
   - [ ] Research hypotheses.
   - [ ] Methodology.
     - [ ] Debates & controversies around the main question.
     - [ ] Axes d'interpretation.
   - [ ] Sources.
     - [ ] Update list of key texts.
     - [ ] Update list of key authors.
*** Research Plan
 The /Research Plan/ serves to identify the different themes and questions that
 should orient the research. 

 Do not confuse the /Research Plan/ with the /Writing Plan/. The former is a guide
 to research, whereas the latter is a guide to writing. In other words, the
 Research Plan is not supposed to constitute the skeleton of the thesis' first
 draft. 

 Discuss with the thesis adviser on the general orientation, and present
 him/her with the Framework and the Research Plan. Do likewise with a group of
 selected readers.

 In /L'art de la these/, Michel Beaud recommends finding a consistent group of
 readers to comment and criticize the thesis work at different stages.
 Following his advise, I have searched for a knowledgeable reader (in the
 subject-matter of the thesis) and an unknowledgeable but /good writer/
 reader. The former should focus (tell him/her explicitly to do so) on content, the
 latter on style and logic (of the argumentation). 

 - [ ] Write the Research Plan:
 - [ ] Present the thesis adviser with the Framework and the Research Plan.
 - [ ] Present the selected readers with the Framework and the Research Plan.
*** Research 
 This is the time for the Final Sifting. Be absolutely careful with this
 stage---lack of diligence could result in missing a key text or a key
 author. Don't waste precious time reading mediocre books; some expound the
 same argument but better. The only thing worse than finding about a key
 text while writing the first draft of the thesis, is being told about it
 during the defense jury. Do /not/ let that happen!

 The same advice for the First Sifting applies: When approaching a text,
 don't read everything, and don't read as a machine.

 Since time is scarce, when choosing whether to read a text, ask yourself:
 Does this text provide any robust argument to address the main question?
 Does it clarify or complement the question somehow?

 Read carefully, and take copious notes.

 I stored all research notes in ~master.org~, ~notes.org~ and ~memoire_draft.org~. 

 Notes about specific authors and texts are in ~master.org~. Notes about
 specific sections (Framework, Research Plan, Outline, Writing Plan, Drafts,
 etc.) are in ~memoire_draft.org~. Thoughts, inspiring ideas, meditations, and
 questions (i.e., most notes) are in ~notes.org~.

 - [ ] Final Sifting:
   - [ ] Update list of key texts.
   - [ ] Update list of key authors.
 - [ ] If necessary, update any component of the Framework, based on your
   findings.
** Preparatory Writing Stage 
*** Draft of the Outline.
 The Outline is the group consisting of the Main Question, the Directing
 Idea, and the Argument (around the directing idea); it is a compass to
 writing the first draft of the thesis. [fn:4]

 The Directing Idea is the one-line response to the Main Question; it should
 structure the Argument. 

 The Argument is the set of logical steps that respond to the Main
 Question. 

 By this advanced stage, it is normal to have witnessed the evolution of the
 Main Question based on the results of the research. After all, it is
 pretentious to think it possible to foresee /a priori/ the findings of
 research. Should this be false, at least in the social sciences, most
 research would be tautological.

 - [ ] Write the Draft of the Outline:
   - [ ] Update the Main Question.
   - [ ] Directing idea. 
   - [ ] Argument.
*** Draft of  Writing Plan. 
 The Writing Plan structures the Argument into parts, chapters, sections,
 subsections, etc. You must provide provisional titles to these structural
 elements---they constitute the skeleton of the first draft of the thesis.

 I repeat: the Research Plan is /not/ the Writing Plan; the former addresses
 you, the researcher, while the latter addresses the audience. Therefore,
 the Writing Plan should be produced thinking about an angle of attack that
 captivates the interest of the reader and convinces him/her that the
 Argument is right. Wielding the Directing Idea as a torch, you should guide
 the reader throughout the structural elements, each with their own Main
 Idea. After lighting up all the Main Ideas in the structural elements, the
 reader should see the light---the answer to the Main Question.

 - [ ] Draft of the Writing Plan.
 - [ ] Discuss these elements with the thesis adviser.
 - [ ] Discuss these elements with the selected readers.
*** Additional Research
 I hesitate to place this stage in this position, but sometimes it is
 necessary. Should anybody (thesis adviser, selected readers) point out any
 major holes in the Argument, this is the stage to paper over them. 

 But this is /not/ the time to rebuild the house from the foundations. Should
 that be the case, you have been sloppy with the Final Sifting. Pray to
 Saint Thomas Aquinas, take a walk in the park, and tinker with the
 Directing Idea. If kicking didn't work so far, try punching.
** Writing Stage
*** Draft of the First Draft of the Thesis.
 This preparatory text identifies the best structural elements to mount over
 the Argument of the thesis.
 - [ ] Draft of the First Draft of the Thesis.
***  Outline and Writing Plan
 After discussing with the thesis adviser and selected readers on the draft
 of the Outline and the Draft of the Writing Plan, incorporate their
 comments into the final version of these elements. 

 - [ ] Write the Outline.
 - [ ] Write the Writing Plan.
*** Classification of the documentation
 Pass one to two weeks classifying the documentation according to the writing
 plan: Create folders for every chapter plus one for the introduction, one
 for the conclusion, and one for unclassified documents (those that do not fit
 in any chapter).[fn:3]

 It's time to classify all the documentation following your Writing Plan. 

 If the same document finds a home in two different chapters, mark that
 document to remember that. Since it is difficult to keep track of every
 document and every old paragraph you have written, your risk repeating the
 same idea over and over. 

 While classifying the documentation, should new ideas (arguments,
 provisory chapter/section titles, etc.) arise, write them in a paper that
 you will deposit in the correct folder. 

 After the documents have been all arranged, there are two possibilities.
**** The folders are filled in a well-balanced manner.
 In the first case, do not read further. Begin writing chapter one of your
 thesis.
**** Some folders are much bigger than others.
 For the second case, some folders are too thick while others are not. 

 For the thick, break up the folder into two chapters or reflect on the
 possibility of moving certain documents elsewhere (only if that would not
 affect the coherence of the Argument).

 For the too thin, there are three possibilities: 
 1. Feed this folder with materials from the thick folders.
 2. The research is insufficient; do supplementary research to enrich the
    arguments and/or the sources.
 3. This chapter is an empty shell (the materials therein are too light).
    Use this material as the conclusion of a bigger chapter of or of the part. 
**** The /Unclassified/ folder resembles King James' Bible
 This is tricky. A choice is necessary: Put this material apart, as it
 might be included in a future article or book. Try to rethink the
 organization of the thesis, using different parts and chapters to fit in
 some of this materials. 
*** First Draft of the Thesis 
 Now is the time to begin writing the First Draft of the Thesis. 

 A similar organization is necessary as that used to constitute the parts
 and chapters. 

 We use one binder per chapter plus one for the introduction, one for the
 conclusion, and one for unclassified documents (it might be necessary to
 have folders for the part introductions and conclusions; that is to say,
 one folder per part.). Inside every binder we will have subdivisions
 according to the number of sections plus one for the chapter introduction,
 one for the chapter conclusion, and one for the unclassified. 

 Likewise, inside every sections, we will divide (with dividers, or
 something else) according to the number of paragraphs. This latter division
 shouldn't be strictly followed but is intended as a guide.  

 - [ ] Discuss the First Draft with the thesis adviser.
 - [ ] Discuss the First Draft with the selected readers.
 - [ ] Correct and rewrite the First Draft. 
*** Last Draft of the Thesis 
Read just the general, part, chapter, section introducing and concluding
paragraphs to ensure the coherence of the train of thought.

Every great structural division---beginning and end of the thesis,
beginning and end of the part, beginning and end of the chapter---has to be
introduced and concluded.

To introduce is to put into perspective the directing idea of the part
(whole thesis, part, chapter), to evoke the framework in which it is
placed, and how it is formulated and treated. 

Likewise, concluding is not just summarizing: it is to group the deployed
elements  that contribute to the directing idea, and synthetize them along
with certain further developpments of response elements to be treated, or
simply to be evoked.

Read the only the titles (as they would appear in the table of contents) to
check that they reflect the train of thought. 

 - [ ] Revise the introductions & conclusions.
 - [ ] Discuss the Last Draft with the thesis adviser.
 - [ ] Discuss the Last Draft with the selected readers.
 - [ ] Correct and rewrite the Last Draft. 
*** Final Version of the Thesis 
 Take a day off, where you are feeling good. Read the whole text to ensure
 the coherence of the whole.

 Besides the group of selected readers, find a reader without previous
 exposure to the thesis. They might give useful comments on the
 organisation of the progression of the train of thought.

 Incorporate any comments into the final version.

 Likewise, check for any ortography and typographical errors. 
** Jury Stage
*** Agreement of Thesis Adviser for Defense (Jury)
*** Fine Tuning
 - [ ] Correct the Final Version. 
*** Printing
*** Due Diligence for Defense
*** Defense
* 無 Time Management
With only one year to finish all thesis work---from planning to
writing---[fn:5], I thought the length of the final document would be about
133 A4-sized pages.

 I calculated I will spend two thirds of the year in research and planning,
and roughly one third of the year in writing (from the first draft to final
version); that I don't write at all during, the time spent in only writing
is expected to be 95 days (about three months). the weekends, and that.

The estimations are taken from Beaud's /L'art de la these/; they
are good enough for the French system, in which a M2 Master's thesis should
be prepared in one year.

The table is coded with Emacs' ~org-mode~, so this code snippet, placed at

#+END_EXAMPLE

Type the number of weeks spent in each stage under the ~Spent~ column, and
the totals will adjust by pressing ~C-c C-c~ while the cursor is on the code
line above.

In the end, the thesis length was XX pages, and the time spent was XX
months for planning, XX months for research, and XX months for writing.

[fn:5] For the academic year 2018-2019, classes begun on September
10th (day of start of classes) and exams for the second semester
finished May 16th. This corresponds with the period of the
thesis.

[fn:4] Instead of /Framework/ and /Outline/, Beaud uses the terms /Problematique
I/ and /Problematique II/. I found his formulation confusing; thus, I oppose
the Framework and Research Plan to the Outline and Writing Plan to
discriminate between two different stages in the preparation of the
thesis. Although I could have used the term Framework II for the Outline, I
thought Outline better reflects its function to organize the text of the
first draft of the thesis. Unfortunately, the term Outline is potentially
confusing because it alludes to the venerable ~I: Introduction~, ~II: Body~,
~III: Conclusion~ schema of high school English composition classes. This is
/not/ what is meant. In fact, do yourself a favor and forget that puerile
schema. Or better, use it sparingly for the plug-and-chug canned writing of
the academic profession's due diligence (exams, research proposals, etc).

[fn:3] Even if you are a master of the digital arts, I recommend using
cardboard folders for this step. Sometimes it helps to spread all the
documentation of a chapter folder on the floor to reflect on the
organization. This holistic view permits a grasp of the documentation that
is not yet possible to achieve with a screen.

[fn:2] These use Emacs' org mode's priorities.
